# Bookies | MERN Book Store Frontend

Website URL: https://book-store-pied-psi.vercel.app/

‚è≥ Please Note:
The backend may take up to 50 seconds to load due to hosting limitations.

This delay happens because the server is hosted on Render's free tier, which automatically puts the service to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. When a new request comes in, the server needs time to spin back up, causing the delay.

Thank you for your patience!
